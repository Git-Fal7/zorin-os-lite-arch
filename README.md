# zorin-os-lite-arch
a script that tries to get the feel of zorin os lite in arch

# stuff i may not try to make it onto my repo
zorin-exec-guard
zorin-connect
and some programs that are zorin os only
# zorin-appearance
zorin-appearance is at a weird state, some files aren't avaliable in the original files.
# zorin menu
here some items that are grayed in the menu:
username (mugshot)
software (gnome-software (i guess we can use pamac and link it))
appearance (zorin-appearance, this option will be grayed untill there is a patch for the original code)
